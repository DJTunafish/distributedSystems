Cost analysis
---------------------------------------------------
Our implementation of the eventually consistent blackboard
has a cost of n-1 for every message posted to a server, which is not
a great improvement over the cost of the centralized blackboard (n+1).
We can also see in the plot of the time required for complete propagation
(see TimeComparisonPlot.png) that the actual time until complete synchronization
occurs has not greatly improved. 
What is gained, however, is that there is no longer a single point of failure.
We still have consistency(eventually, of course) in the system, but are no longer 
dependent on a leader and do not need to run any election protocols.
