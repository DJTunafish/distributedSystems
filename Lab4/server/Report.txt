ALGORITHM DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------

i)  Round 1

    In round 1, each general sends their vote to each other, with any traitors
    sending arbitrary votes to each general.
    Once a general has received votes from every other general and has placed
    its own vote, it collects all received votes into a vector and sends this
    vector to all other generals

ii) Round 2

    Once a general has received all result vectors, it begins to compute the
    final result vector. To determine the vote of general i in the final result
    vector, the general consults all result vectors(including its own), except
    for the result vector of general i. Essentially, the general performs a
    majority vote on what general i voted for, but excludes general i from the
    vote to prevent them from "changing their mind"

TASK 1A
-----------------------------------------------------

We will argue for the correctness of our algorithm in the scenario by showing
that the final result vectors will be identical on each honest general. Below
follows the result vectors received by all generals. Gi denotes a vector sent
from general i and F denotes the final result vector of a general. Within the
vectors, Gi will represent a specific vote from general i, while a single uppercase
letter will represent a variable that could potentially hold any value.

G1:             G2:                  G3:                   G4:
             G1:[A, B,  C,  D]    G1:[E, F,  G,  H]     G1:[I, J,  K,  H]
Byzantine    G2:[X, G2, G3, G4]   G2:[X, G2, G3, G4]    G2:[X, G2, G3, G4]
             G3:[Y, G2, G3, G4]   G3:[Y, G2, G3, G4]    G3:[Y, G2, G3, G4]
             G4:[Z, G2, G3, G4]   G4:[Z, G2, G3, G4]    G4:[Z, G2, G3, G4]
             F:[XYZ, G2, G3, G4]  F:[XYZ, G2, G3, G4]   F:[XYZ, G2, G3, G4]

The first thing to note is that all honest generals agree on a common value for
F[1]: the value XYZ, the result of applying a majority vote to the different values
that G1 sent to all the honest generals. On every node, we know that F[1] will
be computed using the same values(what G1 told G2, G3 and G4 that it voted) as
we know that G2, G3 and G4 are honest. As such, we know that F[1] has the same
value for all generals.

We also know that F[2], F[3] and F[4] will have the same values for all generals.
For example, when computing F[2] on G2, the values B, G2 and G2 will be used.
Regardless of the value of B, G2 has the clear majority and as such F[2] = G2.
This same scenario will occur for the computation of all other indices of F for
all generals.

As we know that all generals will compute the same final result vectors, we also
know that each general will come to the same decision.

TASK 1B
-----------------------------------------------------

G1:             G2:             G3:
             G1:[A, B,  C]   G1:[D, E,  F]
Byzantine    G2:[X, G2, G3]  G2:[X, G2, G3]
             G3:[Y, G2, G3]  G3:[Y, G2, G3]
              F:[U, U,  U]    F:[U, U,  U]

In the scenario where there are only two honest generals and 1 traitor, we can
make no guarantees regarding any of the values in the final result vectors.
For instance, when calculating F[2] on G2, a majority vote with the values
B & G2 will be computed. If B == G2, the result will be G2. Otherwise, the result
will be Unknown. The same holds for the computation of all other indices. As such,
there is a possibility that there will be disagreement between G2 and G3.
