Yes, as can be seen in the screenshot, the second ping 
has a significantly greater roundtrip time. This is 
expected, as the topology is set to have a 10ms delay in 
every link. As all ping messages must traverse two links once in each 
direction (host -> switch -> host -> switch -> host), one would expect
RTTs ~40ms, which are observed in the second ping.
